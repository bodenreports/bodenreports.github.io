                Health and Science Journalist
            </h3>
            <p>
            Sarah Boden is a Pittsburgh-based health and science journalist whose bylines include NPR, Spotlight PA, KFF Health News, BBC, Medscape and Slate. Her audio and print reporting examines how social, environmental and economic forces shape public health and medicine in the U.S.

            Boden has won numerous awards for her health care coverage, including being named the 2025 Keystone Media Freelancer of the Year. In 2023, she won the Keystone Media Award for her series "The cost of forgetting: Dementia's tax on financial health." The project also took the third-place Award of Excellence from the Association of Health Care Journalists.

            Before becoming a full-time freelancer, Boden spent nearly 15 years reporting and producing for NPR member stations, including Pittsburgh's WESA and Iowa Public Radio. In Iowa, she won a regional Edward R. Murrow award for her story about a constitutional challenge to Iowa's felon voting ban.

            When not reporting, Boden is usually in the ceramics studio -- she's slowly throwing a complete set of dishes.

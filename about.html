                Health and Science Journalist
            </h3>
            <p>
            Sarah Boden is a Pittsburgh-based journalist who transitioned to freelancing in May 2024 after 6 1/2 years as the health and science reporter at Pittsburgh's NPR station.
            <span class="spacer"></span>
            Boden has won numerous awards for her health care coverage, including a 2023 Keystone Media Award for her series "The expense of forgetting: Dementia's tax on financial health." The project also won a third-place Award of Excellence from the Association of Health Care Journalists.
            <span class="spacer"></span>
            Before coming to Pittsburgh, Boden was a reporter at Iowa Public Radio, where she won a regional Edward R. Murrow award for her story on a constitutional challenge to Iowa's felon voting ban.

            When not reporting, Boden is usually in the ceramics studio -- she's slowly throwing a complete set of dishes.
